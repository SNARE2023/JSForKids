1.] What are objects? how are they different from arrays?

Objects are a single item with multiple properties. Where as arrays are more of a 
list of numerous things.


2.] Create an object called student with the following fields: Name, age, favourite colour,
 height & zodiac... (WARNING do not believe in astrology. It's nonsense)


 var student = {
 "Name": "Vihaan",
 "Age": 11,
 "Favourite colour": "Lime"
 "Height": "4ft 9inch",
 "zodiac": "Pisces"
};
